# idml-hyperlinks
InDesign IDML file - searches given Stories XML file for cover images named ISBN.jpg, extracts ISBN and spits out XML hyperlinks to be inserted into designmap.xml

Probably better in something other than PHP but was done quickly to help out marketing.

TO DO:
Get Stories XML file name and URL base from command line
Search for ISBN in file name without needing to specify what character it starts at
Hyperlinks don't always link up properly for different styles of image, not sure why!
Spit XML into file or something more useful - open designmap.xml and put hyperlinks in directly
